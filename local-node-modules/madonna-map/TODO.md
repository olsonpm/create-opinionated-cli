### An unordered list of items I may tend to in the future

 - Define error ids/data
 - Figure out a way to share 'madonna-function' while still providing
   'madonna-map' functionality in 'madonna-function'.  Basically madonna-map
   should be a madonna-function, however I want madonna-function to expose
   functionality in madonna-map.  I don't want a third module to be consumed
   by users, so what convention should I use to make it obvious to users its
   purpose is internal only?
 - Expose madonna schema for argMap so madonna-function can consume it
